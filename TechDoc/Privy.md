# Introduction

> Getting started with the Privy REST API

Privy offers low-level APIs you can use to interact with wallets and user objects directly. This means APIs to interface with the following resources:

* **Users**: create user objects with appropriate linked accounts and pregenerate wallets for them.
* **Wallets**: create, update and use wallets across blockchains.
* **Authorization keys**: create and manage authorization keys to manage wallets.
* **Policies**: create and manage policies tied to wallets.
* **Webhooks**: subscribe to Privy webhooks and react to events in your app.

Read more about direct API access below.

## Base URL

All requests to the Privy API must be made to the following base URL:

```
https://api.privy.io
```

HTTPS is required for all requests. HTTP requests will be rejected.

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using Basic Auth and a Privy App ID header. Include the following headers with every request:

<ParamField header="Authorization" type="string" example="Basic ouihv9248hosd9020oihj0v10d=" required>
  Basic Auth header with your app ID as the username and your app secret as the password.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="privy-app-id" type="string" example="cla06f34x0001mh08l8nsr496" required>
  Your Privy app ID as a string.
</ParamField>

Requests missing either of these headers will be rejected by Privy's middleware.

<Info>
  Your Privy app ID and app secret can be found in the [**App settings** >
  **Basics**](https://dashboard.privy.io/apps?page=settings\&tab=basics) tab for your app.

## Rate limits

Privy rate limits REST API endpoints to ensure fair usage and system stability. When you encounter a rate limit (HTTP 429 response), implement retry logic with exponential backoff to handle these gracefully.
